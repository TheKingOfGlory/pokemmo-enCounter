# PokeMMO enCounter
enCounter is an extremely lightweight Python3 script that creates a floating widget window that will count your encounters in PokeMMO!  

This script works a bit differently than the existing ones, the main difference is that this does not use any sort of screen capturing to count the encounters!  
Instead, this lets you configure what key you have set to activate Sweet Scent and how many pokemon are in each horde (you can set this to 1 for single shunting).  
There are also manual increment, decrement, horde increment, horde decrement, and undo buttons (and keybinds) for fine tuning.
